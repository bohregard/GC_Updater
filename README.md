GC_Updater
==========

Simple python updater for adobe flash and java using back ends such as webparser, beautifulsoup, and _winreg.

The Main.py is where the code is run from and fetches the contents based on the Downloads.txt file. After the program is completed the file is written.

The program's main agenda is to download the files and if necessary (provided from user input) install the programs silently in the background.
